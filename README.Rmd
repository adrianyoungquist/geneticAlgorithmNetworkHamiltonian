**Genetic algorithm for automated network Hamiltonian model parameterization**

This package implements the genetic algorithm described in the article:

> *"A Genetic Algorithm for Automated Parameterization of Network Hamiltonian Models of Amyloid Fibril Formation"*  
> by Gianmarc Grazioli, Andy Tao, Inika Bhatia, and Patrick Regan  
> Currently under review at *Digital Discovery* (Royal Society of Chemistry)  
> Preprint: [https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64a3d048ba3e99daef7c671a](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64a3d048ba3e99daef7c671a)

# Installation

You can install the development version of `fibga` from source:

```r
# Install devtools if needed
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install fibga
devtools::install()
```

You will also need to install the following dependencies if they are not installed:
- `network`
- `ergm`
- `orca`
- `parallel`
- `stats`
- `graphics`
- `rmarkdown` (for building vignettes)

---

# Basic Usage

After installing, load the package:

```r
library(fibga)
library(network)
library(ergm)
```

Then you can run a full small evolution:

```r
# Define an initial parameter vector
init_param <- c(100, -30, 10, 26)

# Run evolution
results <- run_full_evolution(init_param = init_param,
                              spheroid_pt_count = 32,
                              radius = 2,
                              node_count = 48,
                              suff_stats = "edges+kstar(2)+nsp(1:2)",
                              fib_type = "2-ribbon",
                              num_generations = 2,
                              burn_time = 2^20,
                              np = 2)

# Plot fibril yield over generations
plot(results$mean_fibril_fractions, type = "b",
     main = "Mean Fibril Yields Across Evolution",
     ylab = "Mean Yield")
```

A full vignette is available with:

```r
browseVignettes("fibga")
```

# Customization for Other Fibril Types

To adapt this package to evolve networks toward different topological structures:

- Use `main.R` as a guide for scripting custom evolution runs.
- Modify `fibril_assay.R` to define new graph structure membership criteria based on ORCA orbit counts.

The core breeding, simulation, and evolution functions are modular and reusable.

# Runtime and Performance

The main function `run_full_evolution()` as configured in example settings typically runs
in under **10 minutes** on a 2019 MacBook Pro with:
- 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor
- 64 GB RAM

Performance will vary depending on:
- Number of nodes
- Burn-in time
- Number of parallel cores
- Number of generations evolved

Parallelism is supported via `parallel::mclapply()`.
