\title{Run Full Evolution Pipeline}
\description{
Executes the full pipeline: sample initial parameter sets, simulate, evolve generations, and evaluate final fibril yield.
}
\details{
This pipeline implements the genetic algorithm described in:
"A Genetic Algorithm for Automated Parameterization of Network Hamiltonian Models of Amyloid Fibril Formation" (Gianmarc Grazioli et al., 2023).
It samples initial points around a known center, selects fibril-forming models, and evolves them.
